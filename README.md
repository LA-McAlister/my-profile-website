This repository is to demostrate how to use Git for version control and how to publosh a website to a public GitHub repository. 

Steps to publish the following code: 
  1. Ran terminal on the project folder and intialized a new git repository for it using: *git init*
  2. Configured Git with my information: *git config --global user.name "Your Full Name"*
  3. Configured Git with my email: *git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"*
  4. Added all files to the staging area: *git add .*
  5. Commited my changes with a meaningful message: *git commit -m "Initial commit of website files"*
  6. In the terminal, added the github repository as remote: *git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/my-profile-website.git*
  7. Pushed commits to GitHub: *git push -u origin master*
